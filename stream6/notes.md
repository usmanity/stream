# Stream thoughts

Streams are getting better.
Some streams I have a lot more energy and some are a little dull.
I should look at ways to get people to actually watch the stream.

### $0 cost setup

All the following were bought for work or gifted at some time in the past, before streaming.

- webcam: $30 off amazon, bought in 2020.
- mic: $15 boom mic attached onto my old Bose QC35 headset.
- twitch and obs are free tools.
- I didn't buy anything special for the stream.

# Keyboard set up

I have a WorkLouder micro keyboard

- It should have QMK / VIA support.
- Streaming layer keyboard shortcuts:
  - Mute / umute mic
  - Key that switches to OBS
- F16 works but F17 didn't work.
- Let's try F19, works on most things
- https://usevia.app/ â€“ great for modifying your keyboard's firmware
- OBS does not support muting/unmuting from the same key outside of the app.
- You have to switch over to OBS to mute. So I used BTT + ^F16.

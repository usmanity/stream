# Git
what is it?

## useful commands
1. diff - see differences
2. commit - save your changes
3. pull & push - get and send your changes
4. clone - download the repository locally
5. branch - different versions of your code
6. checkout - use a different branch in your repo

## Example

### this code doesn't work
if (user.loggedIn === true) {
  // do something
}

# The Shell
> The analogy is with a nut: outside is the shell, inside is the kernel. 
https://l.mhmd.us/bjRrMG

## Kernel
1. Linux
2. Unix
3. MacOS
4. BSD

## useful commands
1. ls
2. cd
3. git
4. mkdir -- makes a new directory
5. touch -- makes a new file
6. rm -- removes a file
7. mv -- moves or renames a file
8. pwd -- path to working directory
9. curl -- stands for client URL, it downloads files from URLs.
10. cat -- concatenate files, mainly used for displaying a file
11. clear -- cleans up your terminal

### cli vs shell vs terminal
cli: command line interface
shell: wraps the kernel
terminal: a program that runs your shell, same thing as a cli

# thoughts on week 2 stream
1. I'm going set up remarkable to demo concepts
2. hopefully the stream was comprehensive enough.
3. recorded video was not high quality, was probably around 720p.
